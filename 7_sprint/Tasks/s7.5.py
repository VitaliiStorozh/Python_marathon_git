# Imagine we are studying an organizational structure which consists of General Managers, Managers, and Developers.
# A General Manager may have many Managers working under him and a Manager may have many developers under him.
# Suppose, you have to determine the total salary of all the employees.
#
# One of the best solutions to the above-described problem is using Composite Method by working
# with a common interface that declares a method for calculating the total salary.

# Note.
#
# We attempt to make an organizational hierarchy with sub-organization,
# which may have subsequent sub-organizations, such as:
# GeneralManager                                   [Composite]
#       Manager1                                   [Composite]
#               Developer11                        [Leaf]
#               Developer12                        [Leaf]
#       Manager2                                   [Composite]
#               Developer21                        [Leaf]
#               Developer22                        [Leaf]
